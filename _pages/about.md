I am a final-year PhD student at UC Berkeley in [BAIR](https://bair.berkeley.edu/) co-advised by [Trevor Darrell](https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~trevor/) and [Dan Klein](https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~klein/). I am currently a 2025 Summer Fellow at the [Centre for the Governance of AI](https://www.governance.ai/) advised by [Robert Trager](https://www.oxfordmartin.ox.ac.uk/people/professor-robert-trager). I am excited to be working on topics focused on AI governance for the capacitation of LATAM and the Global South. 

Prior to Berkeley, I spent a year working with [Zeynep Akata](https://www.eml-unitue.de/people/zeynep-akata)
in the [Amsterdam Machine Learning Lab](http://amlab.science.uva.nl/) through the support of a [Fulbright Student Research](https://us.fulbrightonline.org/fulbright-us-student-program) grant. I received my bachelor's degree in computer science from UT Austin, and was fortunate to get introduced to research by [Ray Mooney](https://www.cs.utexas.edu/~mooney/) 
and [Qixing Huang](https://www.cs.utexas.edu/~huangqx/).

Through my technical research, I aim to contribute to the understanding of how intelligent systems form concepts and abstractions necessary for high-level reasoning, starting from sensorimotor input. Work in compositionality, abstraction, and embodied cognition is of great interest to me.

I am proud to come from [the navel of the moon](https://embamex.sre.gob.mx/reinounido/images/stories/PDF/Meet_Mexico/2_meetmexico-symbolsofmexico.pdf) ðŸ‡²ðŸ‡½ 

Community
======
I am passionate about contributing to efforts working to diversify the AI community and make it more equitable.
Currently, I am the Practicals and Hackathon Chair for [SALA](https://lasala.ai/).
I was most recently a co-organizer of [RIIAA 6.0](https://www.riiaa.org/riiaa6) held in Quito, Ecuador. 
Previously, I was on the board for [RIIAA](https://riiaa.org/en/home/) and on the practicals organizing team for [KHIPU](https://khipu.ai/).
These are Latin American AI conferences and schools aimed at catalyzing the usage/development of AI in Latin America by forging connections between the Latin American and global AI communities.
