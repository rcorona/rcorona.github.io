I am a fifth-year PhD student at UC Berkeley in [BAIR](https://bair.berkeley.edu/) co-advised by [Trevor Darrell](https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~trevor/) and [Dan Klein](https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~klein/).  

Prior to this, I spent a year working with [Zeynep Akata](https://www.eml-unitue.de/people/zeynep-akata)
in the [Amsterdam Machine Learning Lab](http://amlab.science.uva.nl/) through the support of a [Fulbright Student Research](https://us.fulbrightonline.org/fulbright-us-student-program) grant.
I received my bachelor's degree in computer science from UT Austin, and was fortunate to get introduced to research by [Ray Mooney](https://www.cs.utexas.edu/~mooney/) 
and [Qixing Huang](https://www.cs.utexas.edu/~huangqx/).

Through my research, I hope to contribute to the understanding of how intelligent systems form concepts and abstractions necessary for high-level reasoning, starting from sensorimotor input. Work in compositionality, abstraction, and embodied cognition is of great interest to me.  .

Community
======
I am passionate about contributing to efforts working to diversify the AI community and make it more equitable.
Currently, I am a co-organizer [RIIAA](https://riiaa.org/en/home/), a Latin American AI conference and school aimed at catalyzing
the usage/development of AI in Latin America by forging connections between the Latin American and global AI communities.
